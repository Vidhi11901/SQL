-- average score grom the procedures in the same category which are included in the following window frame: 
-- the two previous rows, the current row, and the three following rows in terms of the procedure date.

Select procedure_date,doctor_id,category,name,score,
avg(score) over (partition by category order by procedure_date rows between 2 preceding and 3 following) as Avg_score

-- Ques2 Find the Difference Between Procedure Prices (2 solutions listed below)
-- For each procedure, show the following information: id, procedure_date, name, price, 
-- price of the previous procedure (in terms of the id) and the difference between these two values. 
-- Name the last two columns previous_price and difference.

-- Ques3 Find the Difference Between the Current and Best Prices
-- For each procedure, show the: procedure_date name price category
-- score
-- Price of the best procedure (in terms of the score) from the same category (column best_procedure).
-- Difference between this price and the best_procedure (column difference).

-- Find out which doctor is the best at each procedure. For each procedure, select the procedure name and the 
-- first and last name of all doctors who got high scores (higher than or equal to the average score for this 
-- procedure). Rank the doctors per procedure in terms of the number of times they performed this procedure. 
-- Then, show the best doctors for each procedure, i.e. those having a rank of 1.
